# SlotMachine
Finite state machine implemented in VHDL. When the button is pressed 4 counters start counting (from 0 to 9) each at its own random frequency and show numbers on a display, if the button is pressed again all counters stop counting and show numbers on a display in that moment. If the display shows two or more same numbers then the 2 diodes will be turned on representing in binary how many  matches on a display exist
